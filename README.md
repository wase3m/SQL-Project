# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal is to analyse the traffic on an ecommerce website 

## Process
1) Create a database
2) Import the data
3) Clean the data 
4) Analyse the data
5) Answer the questions

## Results

Through this data we found out about the visitors breakdown for a website and revenue recevied from each city and country.

## Challenges 

It was difficult to import the data as it was tough to track all the different data types used in the tables. The data imported was inconsistent and a lot of the values were missing. A lot of data was unecessary and insignificant in the process to finding answers required. 

## Future Goals
I would clean the data more thoroughly and come up with more precise answers
