## Results

This database gave me an insight into an ecommerce store that sells globally. Majority of its sales comes from the United States with San Francisco having the most revenue generated in terms of the city. The menâ€™s T-shirt appears to be the most selling item whilst most of their sales comes through referral which also signifies customer satisfaction.


## Challenges 

Loading the .csv files into the database.
Cleaning the database. This was a huge challenge as the ecommerce database was full of inconsistencies, NULL, and missing values, outliers, etc.

## Future Goals
Clean the database thoroughly which would help me come up with more accurate analysis and also to further validate and explore the ecommerce database.
